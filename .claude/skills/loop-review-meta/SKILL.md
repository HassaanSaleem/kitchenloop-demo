description: KitchenLoop meta-review phase — read ALL loop-review reports and identify cross-period trends (quality trajectory, recurring/systemic findings, recommendation follow-through, self-improvement score) and write a meta report with systemic recommendations. Recommendations touching gates, cadences, or config keys become ESCALATIONS.md rows, never loop tickets. Use when running a meta review or asked to analyze loop trends across many iterations.

# Loop Review Meta

> Macro analysis across all loop review reports -- trends, recurring themes,
> systemic recommendations.

## Triggers

- `loop review meta`
- `meta analysis`

---

## Overview

Loop Review Meta is a higher-order analysis that reads ALL loop review reports
and identifies patterns that span multiple review periods. While individual
loop reviews catch per-iteration issues, the meta review catches systemic
trends: recurring themes that never get fixed, drift in loop behavior,
effectiveness of self-improvement over time.

---

## Harness Preamble (run before anything else)

This skill runs inside the autonomous loop. Before the procedure below:

1. **STOP sentinel** — if `.kitchenloop/STOP` exists, print its contents, output
   the phase sentinel `[review-meta] STOPPED`, and stop immediately. Run no
   further step.
2. **Read `MANDATE.md`.** Any systemic recommendation matching the ALWAYS-STOP
   list in MANDATE.md (e.g. core schema migrations, changes to money-path
   semantics, changes to the loop's own gates, pushes outside the gated merge
   pipeline, deploys) is NOT a loop-executable change — surface it as an
   `ESCALATIONS.md` row (`| ID | Say | Question | Recommendation | Since |
   Blocks |` plus a context paragraph) instead (see the owner-gate caveat in
   Step 4).
3. **No interactive owner** — never use `AskUserQuestion`. Asks go to
   `ESCALATIONS.md` as rows, never buried in prose.

---

## Procedure

### Step 1: Gather All Review Reports

1. Load `kitchenloop.yaml` -- read `paths`.
2. List all review reports in `{paths.reports}/`:
   ```bash
   ls {paths.reports}/loop-review-iter-*.md
   ```
3. Read each report. Extract structured data:
   - Iteration range covered
   - Metrics (pass rate, test count, backlog, PRs merged)
   - Finding counts by severity (Blocker, Important, Observation)
   - Recommendations made
   - External auditor results

4. Read loop state at `paths.loop_state` for the full iteration history.

### Step 2: Trend Analysis

#### 2a. Quality Trends

Plot (textually) how key metrics have evolved across all review periods:

- **Pass rate trajectory**: Is it trending up (loop is improving the codebase),
  flat (loop is maintaining), or down (loop is introducing regressions)?
- **Test count trajectory**: Growing (good coverage expansion), shrinking
  (test deletion or skip-creep), or flat?
- **Backlog trajectory**: Growing (more issues found than fixed), shrinking
  (good execution velocity), or stable?

#### 2b. Finding Recurrence

Identify findings that appear across multiple review reports:

1. Cluster findings by theme (e.g., "test coverage gaps", "error handling",
   "documentation drift", "convention violations").
2. For each theme, count how many review periods it appeared in.
3. Flag themes that appear in 3+ reviews as **Systemic Issues**.

#### 2c. Recommendation Follow-Through

For each recommendation made in previous reviews:
1. Was it converted to a ticket?
2. Was the ticket resolved?
3. Did the issue recur after the fix?

Calculate a **recommendation effectiveness rate**:
```
effectiveness = recommendations_resolved / recommendations_made
```

### Step 3: Loop Behavior Analysis

#### 3a. Scenario Coverage Map

Aggregate all scenarios tried across all iterations. Build a coverage matrix:

```
            notes-editor  sharing  search
T1 Happy        [5x]       [3x]     [1x]
T2 Compose      [2x]       [0x]     [1x]
T3 Frontier     [1x]       [0x]     [0x]
```

Identify:
- **Over-exercised areas**: Scenarios repeated many times without new findings.
- **Coverage gaps**: Dimension combinations never tried.
- **Tier imbalance**: Is the loop stuck at T1 and never reaching T2/T3?

#### 3b. Self-Improvement Effectiveness

Score the loop's ability to improve itself over time:

1. **Finding novelty**: Are later iterations finding NEW issues, or re-finding
   the same ones? Calculate the ratio of unique findings to total findings.
2. **Fix durability**: When a bug is fixed, does it stay fixed? Count
   regressions of previously-fixed issues.
3. **Escalation rate**: Is the loop progressing from T1 to T2/T3 scenarios
   over time, or staying flat?
4. **Throughput trend**: Is tickets-per-iteration increasing, stable, or
   declining?

Compute an overall **Self-Improvement Score** (0-100):

```
novelty_score     = unique_findings / total_findings * 25
durability_score  = (1 - regression_rate) * 25
escalation_score  = (t2_t3_ratio) * 25
throughput_score   = normalized_throughput_trend * 25
total = novelty + durability + escalation + throughput
```

<!-- CUSTOMIZE: Adjust the scoring weights and formula based on what
     matters most for your project. A project focused on stability might
     weight durability higher. A project focused on coverage expansion
     might weight escalation and novelty higher. -->

### Step 4: Systemic Recommendations

Based on the analysis, generate systemic recommendations that go beyond
individual ticket fixes:

> **Owner-gate caveat (protected gates).** The loop may not tune its own
> gates or cadence. Any recommendation that would change a **gate** (quality bar,
> regression oracle definitions, UAT protocol, quality-sweep rules, MANDATE, or
> the pr-manager review stages), a **cadence** (`runtime.review_interval`,
> `runtime.backlog_interval`, the quality-sweep "every 3rd iteration" cadence), or
> any `kitchenloop.yaml` **`verification.*` / `runtime.*`** key MUST be surfaced as
> an `ESCALATIONS.md` row (one table row + a context paragraph) — NEVER filed as
> a loop-executable ticket and never applied by a later Execute iteration. Only the
> owner lands these. This applies to the "Process changes", "Configuration
> tuning", and "Loop self-tuning" categories below and to the Suggested Config
> Changes block in Step 5: emit those as *escalation proposals*, not as
> actionable config edits.

#### Categories

1. **Process changes**: Adjustments to the loop itself (e.g., "Increase
   review_interval from 3 to 5 -- reviews are not finding enough signal per
   period").

2. **Configuration tuning**: Changes to `kitchenloop.yaml` (e.g., "Add
   {feature_x, feature_y} to spec.blocked until the underlying issue is fixed").

3. **Coverage priorities**: Where the loop should focus next (e.g., "T2
   composition scenarios between notes-editor and sharing have never been tested --
   prioritize this").

4. **Architecture signals**: Patterns that suggest deeper issues (e.g.,
   "Error handling findings appear in every review -- consider a systematic
   error handling audit rather than individual fixes").

5. **Loop self-tuning**: Adjustments the loop should make to its own behavior
   (e.g., "Codex is rejecting 60% of scenarios -- either the ideation is
   drifting out of scope or Codex is too conservative. Review rejection logs").

### Step 5: Write Meta Report

Create the report at `{paths.reports}/loop-review-meta-iter-{start}-{end}.md`:

```markdown
# Meta Review: Iterations {first_iter} -- {last_iter}

**Date**: {timestamp}
**Reviews analyzed**: {count}
**Total iterations covered**: {count}

## Systemic Recommendations

{Numbered list, ordered by expected impact}

1. **[{category}]** {recommendation}
2. **[{category}]** {recommendation}
...

## Suggested Config Changes (escalation proposals — NOT auto-applied)

{Specific kitchenloop.yaml changes, if any. These are PROPOSALS for the owner,
not loop-executable edits. Any change to a gate, cadence, or a `verification.*` /
`runtime.*` key (e.g. `runtime.review_interval`) must be routed to
`ESCALATIONS.md` as a row — the loop cannot land it itself.}

```yaml
# Example (proposal only):
spec:
  blocked:
    - "{new blocked combo}"
runtime:
  review_interval: {new value}   # owner-gated: file an ESCALATIONS.md row
```
```

### Step 6: Emit Meta-Review Metadata (do NOT write loop-state)

**Do NOT write `loop-state.md`** — the regress phase is the sole writer of loop
state (this avoids concurrent-write corruption of the shared file). The meta
report is this phase's durable artifact; record the metadata in the report and
emit it to stdout instead of editing loop state:
- Meta review timestamp
- Self-improvement score
- Number of systemic issues identified
- Coverage gap count

---

## Output Contract

1. **Meta review report** at `{paths.reports}/loop-review-meta-iter-{start}-{end}.md`
2. **Meta-review metadata** emitted to stdout / the report (loop state is written
   by regress, not here)
3. **Actionable recommendations**, with any gate/cadence/config-key change routed
   to `ESCALATIONS.md` as a proposal rather than a loop-executable ticket

---

## When to Run

- Automatically every `runtime.review_interval * 3` iterations (i.e., after
  every 3 regular reviews have accumulated).
- On demand when the loop seems stuck or unproductive.
- After a major milestone (e.g., hitting 50 iterations, reaching 95% pass rate).
